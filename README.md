# UoL_Coursework
## Part 1

In the first part you will be given data collected from various individuals on several variables. The goal will be to use unsupervised learning techniques such as Principal Component Analysis or Cluster Analysis to summarise the information in the data by appropriate tables and/or plots.

## Part 2

In the second part you will be presented with a regression problem. The aim would be to compare various models and techniques for their estimation to allow meaningful interpretation and competitive predictive performance. The latter should be assessed by appropriate experiments based on training and test datasets. In addition to linear regression, Tree based methods, Non-linear models or other suitable techniques can be used if you think they can provide improvement.

Description for Student Performance Dataset
Task:

Build a regression model for the variable G3 (final grade) without using the variables G1 and G2. Interpret the model and assess its predictive performance.

Data Set Information:

This data approach student achievement in secondary education of two Portuguese schools. The data attributes include student grades, demographic, social and school related features) and it was collected by using school reports and questionnaires. 

Two datasets are provided regarding the performance in two distinct subjects: Mathematics (mat) and Portuguese language (por). In [Cortez and Silva, 2008], the two datasets were modeled under binary/five-level classification and regression tasks. 

Important note: the target attribute G3 has a strong correlation with attributes G2 and G1. This occurs because G3 is the final year grade (issued at the 3rd period), while G1 and G2 correspond to the 1st and 2nd period grades. It is more difficult to predict G3 without G2 and G1, but such prediction is much more useful (see paper source for more details).

## Part 3 

Finally, in the third part you will be given a classification problem. The analysis will contain similar steps with the 2nd part but you should be able to interpret the output from different models and compare their predictive performance taking into account that the response variable will be binary. In addition to appropriate regression or discriminant analysis, Tree-based methods, Non-linear models or other suitable techniques can be used if you think they will perform better.

Description for Bank Marketing Dataset
Task:

Build a Classification model to predict if the client will subscribe (yes/no) a term deposit (variable y). Interpret the model and assess its predictive performance.

[Moro et al., 2014] S. Moro, P. Cortez and P. Rita. A Data-Driven Approach to Predict the Success of Bank Telemarketing. Decision Support Systems, Elsevier, 62:22-31, June 2014

Data Set Information:

The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed.

Attribute Information:

Input variables:
## bank client data: 1 - age (numeric)
2 - job : type of job (categorical: 'admin.','blue-collar','entrepreneur','housemaid','management','retired','self-employed','services','student','technician','unemployed','unknown')
3 - marital : marital status (categorical: 'divorced','married','single','unknown'; note: 'divorced' means divorced or widowed)
4 - education (categorical:
'basic.4y','basic.6y','basic.9y','high.school','illiterate','professional.course','university.degree','unknown')
5 - default: has credit in default? (categorical: 'no','yes','unknown')
6 - housing: has housing loan? (categorical: 'no','yes','unknown')
7 - loan: has personal loan? (categorical: 'no','yes','unknown')
# related with the last contact of the current campaign:
8 - contact: contact communication type (categorical: 'cellular','telephone')
9 - month: last contact month of year (categorical: 'jan', 'feb', 'mar', ..., 'nov', 'dec')
10 - day_of_week: last contact day of the week (categorical: 'mon','tue','wed','thu','fri')
11 - duration: last contact duration, in seconds (numeric). Important note: this attribute highly affects the output target (e.g., if duration=0 then y='no'). Yet, the duration is not known before a call is performed. Also, after the end of the call y is obviously known. Thus, this input should only be included for benchmark purposes and should be discarded if the intention is to have a realistic predictive model.
# other attributes:
12 - campaign: number of contacts performed during this campaign and for this client (numeric, includes last contact)
13 - pdays: number of days that passed by after the client was last contacted from a previous campaign (numeric; 999 means client was not previously contacted)
14 - previous: number of contacts performed before this campaign and for this client (numeric)
15 - poutcome: outcome of the previous marketing campaign (categorical: 'failure','nonexistent','success')
# social and economic context attributes
16 - emp.var.rate: employment variation rate - quarterly indicator (numeric)
17 - cons.price.idx: consumer price index - monthly indicator (numeric)
18 - cons.conf.idx: consumer confidence index - monthly indicator (numeric)
19 - euribor3m: euribor 3 month rate - daily indicator (numeric)
20 - nr.employed: number of employees - quarterly indicator (numeric)
Output variable (desired target):
21 - y - has the client subscribed a term deposit? (binary: 'yes','no')
